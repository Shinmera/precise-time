# About Precise-Time
This is a small library hooking into the operating system to give more precise timing information than implementations usually provide via ``get-universal-time`` or ``get-internal-real-time``.

## How To
The usage is straightforward:

``get-precise-time`` returns the precise system time as two values:
- A universal-time timestamp
- Sub-seconds in ``PRECISE-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND``

``get-monotonic-time`` returns a precise monotonic clock as two values:
- Seconds since an arbitrary epoch
- Sub-seconds in ``MONOTONIC-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND``

And that's all!

## Supported Systems
The following systems are supported:

- Unix (Linux, BSD, MacOS)
- Windows
- Mezzano
